# odin-recipes

In this Odin Foundations Course project, I'll build a simple website that showcase a few recipes using HTML. The skills that I demonstrated in this project include setting up the html boilerplate, worked with text using heading and paragraph elements, creating unorganized and organized lists, linking between html documents and displayed images on the webpages.
